                    Text("Tajweed (تجويد) refers to the science and practice of reciting the Quran correctly and beautifully, by giving each letter its proper articulation and characteristics. Linguistically, the word tajweed comes from the Arabic root ج-و-د (j-w-d), meaning \"to improve,\" \"to make excellent,\" or \"to perfect.\" In the context of the Quran, it means reciting the words of Allah as they were revealed precisely, clearly, and with care.")

                    Text("Recitation (قراءة qiraah or تلاوة tilawah) refers to the act of reading the Quran. While qiraah simply means \"reading,\" tilawah carries a deeper meaning of reciting with attentiveness, reflection, and adherence to proper method. Quranic recitation is not just reading text; it is the transmission of a preserved oral tradition passed down from the Prophet ﷺ through generations.")

                    Text("Pronunciation in Quranic recitation is governed by two key components: makharij (مخارج الحروف) and sifat (صفات الحروف). Makharij are the points of articulation, where each letter originates in the mouth or throat, while sifat are the characteristics of those letters, such as heaviness (tafkhim), lightness (tarqiq), or echoing (qalqalah). Together, they ensure that each letter is pronounced distinctly and correctly.")

                    Text("These elements are essential because even slight changes in pronunciation can alter meanings. Tajweed preserves not only the beauty of the Quran, but also its accuracy and integrity. The Quran was revealed to be recited, and Allah commands:")

These differences stem from authentic variations rooted in classical Arabic dialects and were transmitted through reliable chains of recitation.")

                    Text("As a result, some rules explained in this guide may not apply identically to other riwayat. These variations in tajweed application and pronunciation reflect the diversity of classical Arabic dialects that were all correctly recited and approved by the Prophet ﷺ, and have been preserved exactly through continuous transmission. They highlight the richness, flexibility, and authenticity of the Quranic recitation tradition.")
